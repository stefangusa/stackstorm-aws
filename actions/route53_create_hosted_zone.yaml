    description: "The name of the domain. For resource record types that include a domain name, specify a fully qualified domain name, for example, www.example.com. The trailing dot is optional; Amazon Route 53 assumes that the domain name is fully qualified. This means that Amazon Route 53 treats www.example.com (without a trailing dot) and www.example.com. (with a trailing dot) as identical. If you're creating a public hosted zone, this is the name you have registered with your DNS registrar. If your domain name is registered with a registrar other than Amazon Route 53, change the name servers for your domain to the set of NameServers that CreateHostedZone returns in the DelegationSet element."
