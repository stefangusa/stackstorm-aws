  Filters:
    type: array
    description: "One or more filters.    create-time - The creation time of the AFI.    fpga-image-id - The FPGA image identifier (AFI ID).    fpga-image-global-id - The global FPGA image identifier (AGFI ID).    name - The name of the AFI.    owner-id - The AWS account ID of the AFI owner.    product-code - The product code.    shell-version - The version of the AWS Shell that was used to create the bitstream.    state - The state of the AFI (pending | failed | available | unavailable).    tag:key=value - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource. Specify the key of the tag in the filter name and the value of the tag in the filter value. For example, for the tag Purpose=X, specify tag:Purpose for the filter name and X for the filter value.    tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both the filter 'tag-key=Purpose' and the filter 'tag-value=X', you get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose is X, see the tag:key=value filter.    tag-value - The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-key filter.    update-time - The time of the most recent update.  "
