    description: "For stacks in the DELETE_FAILED state, a list of resource logical IDs that are associated with the resources you want to retain. During deletion, AWS CloudFormation deletes the stack but does not delete the retained resources. Retaining resources is useful when you cannot delete a resource, such as a non-empty S3 bucket, but you want to delete the stack."
  RoleARN:
    type: string
    description: "The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that AWS CloudFormation assumes to delete the stack. AWS CloudFormation uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf. If you don't specify a value, AWS CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, AWS CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user credentials."
