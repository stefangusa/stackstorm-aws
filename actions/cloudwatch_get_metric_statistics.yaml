  StartTime:
    type: string
    description: "The time stamp that determines the first data point to return. Note that start times are evaluated relative to the time that CloudWatch receives the request. The value specified is inclusive; results include data points with the specified time stamp. The time stamp must be in ISO 8601 UTC format (for example, 2016-10-03T23:00:00Z). CloudWatch rounds the specified time stamp as follows:   Start time less than 15 days ago - Round down to the nearest whole minute. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:32:00.   Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 5-minute clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:30:00.   Start time greater than 63 days ago - Round down to the nearest 1-hour clock interval. For example, 12:32:34 is rounded down to 12:00:00.  "

  EndTime:
    type: string
    description: "The time stamp that determines the last data point to return. The value specified is exclusive; results will include data points up to the specified time stamp. The time stamp must be in ISO 8601 UTC format (for example, 2016-10-10T23:00:00Z)."

  Period:
    type: integer
    description: "The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points. A period can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be a multiple of 60. The default value is 60. If the StartTime parameter specifies a time stamp that is greater than 15 days ago, you must specify the period as follows or no data points in that time range is returned:   Start time between 15 and 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes).   Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a multiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour).  "
    required: true
  Dimensions:
    type: array
    description: "The dimensions. CloudWatch treats each unique combination of dimensions as a separate metric. You can't retrieve statistics using combinations of dimensions that were not specially published. You must specify the same dimensions that were used when the metrics were created. For an example, see Dimension Combinations in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide."
  Statistics:
    type: array
    description: "The metric statistics, other than percentile. For percentile statistics, use ExtendedStatistic."
  ExtendedStatistics:
    type: array
    description: "The percentile statistics. Specify values between p0.0 and p100."
  Unit:
    type: string
    description: "The unit for a given metric. Metrics may be reported in multiple units. Not supplying a unit results in all units being returned. If the metric only ever reports one unit, specifying a unit has no effect."
