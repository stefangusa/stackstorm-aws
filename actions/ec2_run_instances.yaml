  DryRun:
    type: boolean
    description: "Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation. Otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation."
  KeyName:
    type: string

  BlockDeviceMappings:
    type: array
    description: "The block device mapping.  Supplying both a snapshot ID and an encryption value as arguments for block-device mapping results in an error. This is because only blank volumes can be encrypted on start, and these are not created from a snapshot. If a snapshot is the basis for the volume, it contains data by definition and its encryption status cannot be changed using this action. "

  Ipv6AddressCount:
    type: integer
    description: "[EC2-VPC] A number of IPv6 addresses to associate with the primary network interface. Amazon EC2 chooses the IPv6 addresses from the range of your subnet.
